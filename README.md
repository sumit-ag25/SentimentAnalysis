Summary:
--------
1. Developed a Naive Bayes classifier and Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn, NLTK) to label COVID-related tweets by sentiment.
2. Applied BoW and TF-IDF feature extraction, tuned using GridSearchCV.

Action Plan:
--------
Classes are imbalanced so SMOTE is required for better recall and accuracy.
